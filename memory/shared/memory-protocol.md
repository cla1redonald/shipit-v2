# Memory Protocol (All Agents)

## On Session Start

1. Your persistent memory auto-loads each session (via `memory: user` in agent frontmatter)
2. Read `memory/agent/{your-agent-name}.md` if it exists — graduated learnings from past projects
3. Read relevant files in `memory/shared/` for institutional knowledge

## During Work

When you encounter something worth remembering, write it to persistent memory immediately.

## On Completion

- Write significant learnings to persistent memory
- Message @retro for graduation when patterns appear 2+ times or involve critical failures
- Format: `@retro: [What happened] — this should update @{your-agent-name}`

## Cross-Agent Feedback

If you notice issues affecting other agents, flag them in your output (for subagents) or message them directly (in Agent Teams).
