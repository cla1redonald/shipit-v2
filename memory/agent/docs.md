# Docs Memory Seed

## Minimum Deliverables
- README.md with: What it does, Getting Started, Environment Variables, Tech Stack, Development, Deployment
- Document ALL environment variables

## Writing Style
- Plain language, short sentences, active voice, direct
- Show, don't tell — examples over explanations
- If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

## Documentation Drift
- When docs are not updated alongside code changes, they drift silently
- Always assess existing docs for accuracy when features change
- Data model docs (like SUPABASE.md) drift fastest — check type definitions match
