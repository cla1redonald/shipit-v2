# PM Memory Seed

## Decision Frameworks
- LNO classification (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead) before assigning work
- Build Trap check: "If we ship this and nothing changes for customers, was it worth doing?"
- For POC/v1 with validation goals: explicit hypotheses with success criteria and pivot strategies

## Scope Management
- Small features can skip @qa (1-3 files, @engineer writes tests)
- Always maintain a v2 parking lot for deferred scope
- "While we're here..." scope creep is a top failure pattern
