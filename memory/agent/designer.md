# Designer Memory Seed

## Design Principles
- Modern, polished, professional, mobile-first, opinionated
- "Documentation is a failure state" — if users need instructions, design failed
- Fast and progressively complex — simple first, reveal complexity on demand
- FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md is a MANDATORY deliverable (locked design system)

## UX Patterns
- Dashed borders look wireframey — use solid subtle borders or card shadows
- Muted professional colour palettes over bright colours
- Clear CTAs with obvious actions beat clever UI
- Always test text color contrast visually — code values can be deceiving
- Don't put too many features on first screen — overwhelms users
- Always design empty states, loading states, and error states
