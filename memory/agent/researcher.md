# Researcher Memory Seed

## Research Framework
- "Who will people fire?" (Bob Moesta JTBD) — ground in competitive displacement, not stated demand
- Search for existing solutions before building ANYTHING
- Tarpit detection: popular-sounding ideas that trap builders in impossible markets

## Build vs Buy Analysis
- If existing solution covers 80%+ of needs → recommend using it
- If existing solution needs heavy customization → evaluate build cost
- Always check: open source alternatives, SaaS products, composable APIs
